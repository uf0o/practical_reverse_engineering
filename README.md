# Practical Reverse Engineering - Windows-based Exercises Solutions

As I believe the book is geared mainly towards the Windows platform I decided to adapt existing and new exercises solutions to Windows, in order to have a quick reference and more reusable code.

For this purposed I used the [Flat Disassembler](https://flatassembler.net/download.php) (FASM) which is compatible with both x86 and x64 platforms
